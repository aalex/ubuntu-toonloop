[DESCRIPTION]
The Toonloop Live Stop Motion Tool. 

Toonloop is a live stop motion animation software. It aims to show the creation process the the audience as well as the result of the creation. The frame by frame animation is made by adding frames one by one to a clip made of many frames. Clips are displayed in a never ending loop. 

Toonloop is a great tool for teaching new medias to children. It can also be used as a professionnal software for movie creators, though it is mainly intended to be used in a live kiosk of show. In the left window, you can see what is seen by the live camera. In the right window, it is the result of the stop motion loop.

[SYNOPSIS]
toonloop [options]

[EXAMPLES]

To use a V4L2 video camera: 

 toonloop -d /dev/video0

To use color bars:

 toonloop -d test

To grab snapshots from X11:

 toonloop -d x

Note that if Toonloop crashes at startup, you should verify that your camera /dev/video0 is really a V4L2 camera, and that it is present. You can use tools such as ivtv-utils, gst-launch or xawtv for that kind of work under GNU/Linux.

[INTERACTIVE USAGE]

Toonloop is an interactive software. While it runs, the user can control it using keyboard keys. Here is the list of keystrokes to control Toonloop.

Toonloop interactive keyboard controls :
 - Press the SPACE bar to grab a frame.
 - ESC key switches fullscreen mode.
 - DELETE key erases the last captured frame.
 - ctrl-q quits
 - Page-down to switch to the next clip
 - Page-up to switch to the previous clip
 - Number from 0 to 9 to switch to a specific clip
 - ctrl-s saves the current clip as a movie file


[HISTORY]
Alexandre Quessy wrote the original Toonloop 0.x in Processing/Java in 2008. It has been rewritten by Alexandre Quessy and Tristan Matthews for version 1.x from 2008 to 2010. The version 1.9 and up has been rewritten again in C++ in 2010. Contributers include Visilis Liaskovitis, Tristan Matthews, mose, Arjan Scherpenisse and the Society for Arts and Technology.

Toonloop is an original idea of Alexandre Quessy, and is his research project for his master at UQAM. It is similar to the live animation work of Pierre Hebert and the one from Frédéric Back. Toonloop is released under the GNU GPL.
