[DESCRIPTION]
Toonloop is a live stop motion animation software. It aims to show the creation process to the audience as well as the result of the creation. The frame by frame animation is made by adding frames one by one to a clip made of many frames. Clips are displayed in a never ending loop. 

Toonloop is a great tool for teaching new medias to children. It can also be used as a professionnal software for movie creators, though it is mainly intended to be used in a live kiosk of show. In the left window, you can see what is seen by the live camera. In the right window, it is the result of the stop motion loop.

Toonloop can be controlled using MIDI input, or the Open Sound Control protocol. Images are saved to the disk in the JPEG formant, and the clips are saved using the photo-JPEG video codec (using mencoder). 

[SYNOPSIS]
toonloop [options]

[EXAMPLES]

To use a V4L2 video camera: 

 toonloop -d /dev/video0

To use color bars:

 toonloop -d test

To grab snapshots from X11:

 toonloop -d x

Note that if Toonloop crashes at startup, you should verify that your camera /dev/video0 is really a V4L2 camera, and that it is present. You can use tools such as ivtv-utils, gst-launch or xawtv for that kind of work under GNU/Linux.

[INTERACTIVE USAGE]
Toonloop is an interactive software. While it runs, the user can control it using keyboard keys. Here is the list of keystrokes to control Toonloop.

Toonloop interactive keyboard controls :
 - SPACE: grab a single image.
 - ESC: switches fullscreen mode.
 - DELETE: erases the last captured frame.
 - Ctrl-q: quits
 - Page-down: switch to the next clip
 - Page-up: switch to the previous clip
 - Number from 0 to 9: switch to a specific clip
 - s: saves the current clip as a movie file
 - period: toggles the layout
 - Tab: changes the playback direction
 - r: clears the current clip.
 - Caps lock: toggle video grabbing.
 - a: Toggles on/off the intervalometer
 - k: increase intervalometer interval by 1 second
 - j: decrease intervalometer interval by 1 second
 - right: move writehead to the next image
 - left: move writehead to the previous image
 - return: move writehead to the last image
 - semicolon: move writehead to the first image
 - o: enable/disable onion skinning
 - (): decrease/increase frame blending in playback
 - []: increase/decrease opacity of the live input image in the overlay layout.

[OSC INTERFACE]
Toonloop can send and receive messages using the Open Sound Protocol. 

The list of messages it handles and might send is available in the OSC file that is in the project directory.

[MIDI INTERFACE]
Toonloop can be used with MIDI control devices. Here is the list of controls it supports: 

 - 64: (sustain pedal) Grabs a still image
 - 80: Grabs video
 - Program change: choose a clip
 - 7: (main volume) changes playback speed

The Roland GFC-50 Foot Controller is a nice MIDI device that is useful to
control Toonloop. The sustain pedal controls single-image grabbing,
the pedal control number 80 toggles video recording on and off, the
volume pedal controls the playback speed and the 10 program changes
select the clip that is currently edited and played back. See

about this device.
