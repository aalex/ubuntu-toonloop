.SH NAME
toonloop \- The Toonloop Live Animation Performance Tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
toonloop [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Toonloop is a live stop motion animation software. It aims to show the creation process to the audience as well as the result of the creation. The frame by frame animation is made by adding frames one by one to a clip made of many frames. Clips are displayed in a never ending loop. Toonloop can also grab video images continuously.

Toonloop is a great tool for teaching new medias to children. It can also be used as a professional software for movie creators, though it is mainly intended to be used in a live kiosk of show. In the left window, you can see what is seen by the live camera. In the right window, it is the result of the stop motion loop. To add an image to the current clip, simply press the space bar.

Toonloop can be controlled using MIDI input, or the Open Sound Control protocol. (OSC) Images are saved to the disk in the JPEG format, and the clips are saved using the photo-JPEG video codec. (using mencoder)

.SH EXAMPLES
Choosing the video input can be tricky. The name of the GStreamer video source element is guessed from the \-\-video-source option. (its short form is \-d) If it's "/dev/video0" or "/dev/video1", Toonloop will use the v4l2src element. (a Video4Linux 2 video device) 

To use a V4L2 video camera:

 toonloop \-d /dev/video0

To use a DV video Firewire camera:

 toonloop \-d dv

To display some color bars:

 toonloop \-d test

To continuously grab screeshots from X11: (very slow)

 toonloop \-d x

Note that if Toonloop crashes at startup, you should verify that your camera /dev/video0 is really a V4L2 camera, and that it is present. The default width and height are 640x480. You might try to change those using the \-\-width and \-\-height options. You can use tools such as ivtv\-utils, gst\-launch, gst\-inspect or xawtv to investigate about your video devices under GNU/Linux.

Some Toonloop features are enabled only when a value is given for their option. It is the case for MIDI, OSC sending and OSC receiving.
 - MIDI is enabled if the user specifies a \-\-midi-input
 - OSC sending is enabled if the user specifies a \-\-osc-send-port
 - OSC receiving is enabled if the user specifies a \-\-osc-receive-port

Here is how to launch a fullscreen timelapse:

 toonloop \-\-enable-intervalometer \-\-intervalometer\-rate 0.1 \-\-playhead\-fps 60 \-\-max\-images\-per\-clip 600 \-\-remove\-deleted\-images \-\-fullscreen \-\-layout 2 \-\-verbose
.SH "INTERACTIVE USAGE"

Toonloop interactive keyboard controls :
 - Space: Grab a single image.
 - Escape: Switch fullscreen mode.
 - Delete: Erase the last captured frame.
 - Ctrl-q: Quit.
 - Page-down: Switch to the next clip.
 - Page-up: Switch to the previous clip.

 - j: Decrease the intervalometer interval by 1 second.
 - Right: Move writehead to the next image.
 - Left: Move writehead to the previous image.
 - Return: Move writehead to the last image.
 - semicolon (;): Move writehead to the first image.
 - o: Enable/disable onion skinning.
 - (): Decrease/increase frame blending in playback layout.
 - []: Increase/decrease opacity of the live input image in the overlay layout.
 - F1: Show help.
.SH "OSC INTERFACE"
Toonloop can send and receive messages using the Open Sound Protocol. 

Messages Toonloop can receive:

 - /ping: Answer with /pong
 - /pong: Do nothing.
 - /toon/quit: Quit
 - /toon/frame/add: Grab a frame
 - /toon/frame/remove: Remove a frame
 - /toon/clip/select i:clip_number : Selects a clip
 - /toon/clip/save_current : Saves the currently selected clip
 - /toon/clip/import_image s:file_name : Imports an image from the filesystem

Toonloop sends the following OSC messages:

 - /pong
 - /toon/clip/cleared i:clip_number
 - /toon/clip/fps i:clip_number i:fps
 - /toon/clip/playhead i:clip_number i:image_number s:file_name
 - /toon/clip/saved i:clip_number s:file_name
 - /toon/clip/select i:clip_number
 - /toon/frame/add i:clip_number i:frame_number
 - /toon/frame/remove i:clip_number i:frame_number
 - /toon/playhead/direction i:clip_number s:direction
 - /toon/playhead/none
.SH "MIDI INTERFACE"
Toonloop can be used with MIDI control devices. The MIDI bindings are configurable by editing an XML file. This way, anyone can decide how to control Toonloop with any different MIDI controller. 

The default presets are set so that the sustain pedal controls single-image grabbing, and program change controls clip selection.

To customize the MIDI binding rules, one must copy the midi.xml that comes with Toonloop (typically installed in /usr/share/toonloop/presets/midi.xml) into ~/.toonloop/midi.xml. The syntax of that MIDI rules file is pretty straightforward. For example, the following rule makes it so that pressing the note 60 down selects clip number 19. (60 is the central C note on a piano)

 <note_on number="60" action="select_clip" args="19" />

Other possible actions include setting the value of a float or int property of the main Toonloop controller. The following rule specifies that pressing the sustain pedal down grabs and image.

  <control_on number="64" action="add_image" />

See the documentation for the MidiBinder class for more about MIDI rules. Run Toonloop with the --print-properties option to list the properties you can change using the "control_map" rule and the "set_float" or "set_int" action.
