2010-10-08: Toonloop 2.0.0
--------------------------

This release is the first release of the 2.0 series! After eight months of development, Toonloop 2.0 is finally ready be released. A stable release means that the command-line options and the interactive keyboard controls should not change much for all tags with 2.0 as major-minor numbers. Some new features might be developped in that branch, but each release should be backward-compatible with their ancestor. The next unstable development branch is 2.1. The next stable series is 2.2. 

This version contains new features and bug fixes. 

New features:
    * Added the --max-images-per-clip option. Default is 0. (infinity)
    * Added the --intervalometer-rate option
    * Added the --enable-intervalometer option
    * Added the --layout option
    * Using a messaging queue for the OSC callbacks
    * Added the --remove-deleted-images option
    * Improved the man page


Bug fixes: 
    * Fixed a crash when the OSC interface was enabled.
    * Then, fixed another crash when the OSC interface was not enabled.
