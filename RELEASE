2010-08-27: Toonloop 1.9.3

This release is an unstable version in the 1.9 series. This version contains new features preparing the 2.0 stable series. At this point, it's almost feature-complete with a basic GUI for live performances.

New features:
    * Created the Controller class
    * Hitting the period key toggles the layout
    * moved Application::on_pedal_down to MidiInput::on_pedal_down
    * Improved comments to create doc with doxygen.
    * Added the make html target, which creates HTML doc with doxygen
    * adding file OSC, which documents the OSC messages send/received
    * documented key strokes
    * Tab changes the playback direction
    * The r key clears the current clip
    * Changed for an icon that is visible on a black or white background

Bug fixes: 
    * removed unused shader.cpp
    * Using unsigned int for images and clips
    * passing Application* to most classes to their owner_ attribute
    * use const std::string & parameters
    * use forward declarations where possible
    * application: keep free function out of global namespace
    * application: use pointers instead of references, and iterators instead of raw for loops
    * application: fixed memory leak. Make sure we delete unordered map clips_ in destructor
    * clip: catch out_of_range in get_image
    * use scoped_ptr instead of shared_ptr where possible.
    *  limit scope of using declarations
    * removed unused parameters, added extra warning flags
    * constructor invocation cleanup. removed extraneous parentheses when calling new
    * application.cpp:137: create objects on the stack when possible
    * Fixed a bug with first image same as before after the clip is cleared
    * Setting up the OSC sender port doesn't work
    * No more crash when we delete an image sometimes.
    * removed the Application::get_instance singleton static method
    * Figured out why the call to get_image in gui.cpp is sometimes out_of_range playhead when we delete frames

Know bugs:
    * The user cannot use gstreamer-properties to choose a camera, but must provide a command-line argument to Toonloop.
