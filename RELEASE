2011-02-02 Toonloop 2.1.10
--------------------------

This release is a snapshot in the 2.1 unstable series. 

This version contains new features and bug fixes. It introduce a change in the user interface that is not backward-compatible. 

New features:
    * Added support for DV cameras
    * State saving as a project.xml file (all clips with their FPS, direction and images)

Changes in the user interface:
    * Now use Ctrl-e to export the current clip as a movie file. It used to be done by simply pressing the "s" key.

Bug fixes:
    * Removed gdk_pixbuf_unref since it is deprecated.
    * Check for raw1394 and avc1394
    * Check for install and ln -s
    * Removed "Leaving Toonloop" text which ended up in the man page

Have fun with Toonloop!
